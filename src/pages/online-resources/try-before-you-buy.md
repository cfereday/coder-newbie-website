In a lot of cases you can try working in a language (or with a technology) without committing the time to setting up tools on a computer (a process even very experience developers can find both time consuming and frustrating)

## 'Try' tools
These allow you to play around with technologies and languages. You are generally limited in how far you can go but are useful for seeing how a language or technology feels - especially if you have limited time.
* [RabbitMQ Simulator](http://tryrabbitmq.com/) - allows you to create a simulated RabbitMQ messaging infrastructure.
* [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - learning to work with Git branches. (also linked to from [Resources to learn Git](https://try.github.io/))
* [Visualizing Git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/)- an 'under the hood' view on what happens in Git
* [Try Haskell](https://www.tryhaskell.org/) - an interactive tutorial
* [Klipse for Kids](http://kids.klipse.tech/) - mainly targetted at kids but is still a nice intro to Clojure coding in a browser

* [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) - supports working in React, Angular, Vue, Preact and vanilla JS
* [Ellie-app](https://ellie-app.com) - Ellie, online Elm editor
* [Introduction to Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/buttons.html) - an interactive Elm tutorial using the online Ellie Elm editor
